Abstract
DigiMap is a repository of Roche digital solutions mapped by disease areas and customer journey which are at different initiative status. The first part of this project aims to unify different data sources and provide a clear and dynamic
Tableau visualization of the whole repository so that one can easily filter and extract specific information. The second 
part consists of the description and implementation of a data mining pipeline which has the aim of identifying patterns
and providing insights about whether a solution should be rolled out globally. This has been accomplished with text 
mining techniques that has enabled to process a semi-structured dataset in a structured format using WEKA toolbox.
