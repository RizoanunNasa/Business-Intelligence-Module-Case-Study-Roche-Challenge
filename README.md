# Business Intelligence Module Case Study: Roche Challenge


DigiMap is a repository of Roche digital solutions mapped by disease areas and customer journey which are at different initiative status. The first part of this project aims to unify different data sources and provide a clear and dynamic
Tableau visualization of the whole repository so that one can easily filter and extract specific information. The second 
part consists of the description and implementation of a data mining pipeline which has the aim of identifying patterns
and providing insights about whether a solution should be rolled out globally. This has been accomplished with text 
mining techniques that has enabled to process a semi-structured dataset in a structured format using WEKA toolbox.



##  Business Understanding
The expectation is that one can search for relevant information, and solution (particularly disease journeys)
based on the different criterias and connect with the right contact while identifying what solutions are best 
suited for adoption by other countries on a unified dashboard. The following questions will be examined:

## Data Exploration and Visualisation
Analytical Question 1: How many solutions are available in each “Therapeutic / Disease Area”?

Analytical Question 2: Which solutions (per disease area / per initiative status) are available / not 
available in which countries/regions?
